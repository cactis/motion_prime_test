1
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,360
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

2
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,400
All signs point to this planet
as the location of Zurg's fortress,

3
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,120
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

4
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,480
Come to me, my prey.

5
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,920
To infinity and beyond!

6
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,840
So, we meet again,
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.

7
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,640
Not today, Zurg!

8
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,880
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, you almost had him.

9
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,880
-I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
-Sure, you will, Rex.

10
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,360
In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am.

11
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
But look at my little arms!

12
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,960
I can't press the "fire" button
and jump at the same time!

13
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Where is it? Where is it?

14
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
Woody?

15
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,960
Hang on, cowboy!

16
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,760
-Woody, are you all right?
-Yeah.

17
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your
list of things to do while I'm gone.

18
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,760
Batteries need to be changed.

19
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,680
Toys in the bottom of the chest
need to be rotated.

20
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,040
Oh, and make sure everyone
attends Mr. Spell's seminar

21
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,000
on what to do
if you or a part of you is swallowed.

22
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,680
Okay? Okay. Good. Okay.

23
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,880
Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?

24
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
No! And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,

25
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
and I can't find it anywhere!

26
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,640
Don't worry, Woody.
In just a few hours,

27
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,280
you'll be sitting around a campfire with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."

28
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,920
-They're called s'mores, Buzz.
-Right. Right. Of course.

29
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?

30
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,600
Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.

31
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,480
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.

32
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,520
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.

33
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
-I found it.
-You found my hat?

34
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,560
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.

35
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,200
-Oh, my little sweet potato!
-Oh, you found it!

36
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,480
Oh, it's so nice

37
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,960
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.

38
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,440
Oh, great. That's just great.

39
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
This'll be the first year I miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!

40
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,760
-Woody, look under your boot.
-Don't be silly.

41
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,160
-My hat is not under my boot.
-Would you just look?

42
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,200
No hat. Just the word "Andy."

43
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,160
And the boy who wrote that

44
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,480
would take you to camp
with or without your hat.

45
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm sorry, Bo.

46
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,880
It's just that I've been
lookin' forward to this all year.

47
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,040
It's my one time with just me and Andy.

48
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,040
You're cute when you care.

49
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,040
-Bo, not in front of Buzz.
-Let him look.

50
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,080
Miss Peep, your sheep!

51
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,000
This is Al from Al's Toy Barn,

52
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,480
-and I'm sittin' on good deals.
-Whoa!

53
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,120
I think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.

54
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,920
Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got
boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck...

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,400
-Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear!
-Which one is off?

56
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,520
Buck, buck, buck!
And that's cheap, cheap, cheap!

57
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
So hurry on down...

58
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,880
For cryin' out loud, it's this one.

59
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,720
-I despise that chicken.
-Fellas! Fellas!

60
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,840
Okay, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

61
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,440
What news?

62
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,680
The good news is
I found your hat, Woody.

63
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,200
My hat! Slink, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

64
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,880
-Where'd you find it?
-Well, that's the bad news.

65
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Oh, it's Buster!

66
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
Canine alert! Man your battle stations!

67
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,880
Let's move, move, move!

68
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,440
Woody! Hide! Quick!

69
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,240
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay! You found me!

70
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,480
Buster, all right.
Hey, how did he do, Hamm?

71
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,040
-Looks like a new record.
-Okay, boy. Sit.

72
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,480
Reach for the sky.

73
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,280
Gotcha!

74
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,280
Great job, boy.

75
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,680
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?

76
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Who's gonna miss me?

77
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
Andy, you got all your stuff?

78
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,120
Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.

79
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,920
It's in my room.

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,720
Stick 'em up.

81
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,720
I guess we'll work on that later.

82
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?

83
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,080
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin'.

84
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
Five minutes.

85
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
Help, help! Somebody help me!

86
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,640
Let her go, evil Dr Pork Chop!

87
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,800
Never!

88
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,480
You must choose, Sheriff Woody.
How shall she die?

89
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,880
Shark, or death by monkeys?

90
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,480
Choose!

91
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
I choose Buzz Lightyear!

92
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,040
What? That's not a choice!

93
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,520
To infinity and beyond!

94
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,880
-I'll save you, Miss Peep.
-My hero.

95
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,320
-Thanks, Buzz.
-No problem, buddy.

96
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,280
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo

97
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!

98
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,400
Oh, no.

99
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.

100
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,400
-But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped.
-Oh, no.

101
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,040
-Maybe we can fix him on the way.
-No, just leave him.

102
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,720
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.

103
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
-What happened?
-Woody's been shelved.

104
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
Andy!

105
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,800
-Woody?
-Woody? Honey, are you okay?

106
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,800
Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!

107
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,480
He's back?
Hey, everybody! Andy's back!

108
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,160
He's back early from cowboy camp!

109
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,680
Places, everybody! Andy's coming!

110
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,120
Yeah!

111
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,840
Hey, Woody! Did you miss me?

112
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,040
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!

113
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,280
I forgot. You're broken.

114
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,520
I don't wanna play with you any more.

115
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,320
No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No!

116
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Andy. Andy.

117
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Bye, Woody.

118
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,960
No! No! Andy!

119
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,400
Wheezy, is that you?

120
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,600
-Hey, Woody.
-What are you doing up here?

121
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,840
I thought Mom took you
to get your squeaker fixed months ago.

122
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,160
-Andy was so upset.
-Nah.

123
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
She just told him that
to calm him down

124
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,200
and then put me on the shelf.

125
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,440
-Why didn't you yell for help?
-Well, I tried squeakin'.

126
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,000
But I'm still broken.
No one could hear me.

127
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.

128
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,480
What's the point
in prolonging the inevitable?

129
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,440
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.

130
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,480
Yard sale? Yard sale!

131
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,480
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!

132
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,520
-Yard sale?
-Sarge, emergency roll call!

133
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,520
Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!

134
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,640
All civilians fall in position now!
Single file! Let's move, move, move!

135
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,680
-Hamm?
-Here.

136
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,080
-Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.?
-Here.

137
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,920
Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.

138
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,360
I hate yard sales!

139
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,640
Someone's coming!

140
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,040
Okay. Let's see what's up here.

141
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,280
Bye, Woody.

142
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,240
Wheezy! Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

143
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,520
Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!

144
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,320
Up here! No, no, no, no, no, no!

145
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
Okay, boy. To the yard sale!

146
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,040
What's goin' on? He's nuts.

147
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
His arm ain't that bad.

148
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,640
Don't do it, Woody! We love you!

149
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Careful on the steps, now.

150
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,880
Okay, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.

151
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,200
Not that casual.

152
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,480
Piggy bank coming through,
coming through.

153
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
-Is he out there?
-There he is.

154
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,360
He's getting in the box!

155
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,560
He's sellin' himself for 25 cents!

156
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,240
Woody, you're worth more than that.

157
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,560
Hold on. Hold on. He's got something.

158
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,200
-It's Wheezy!
-Wheezy?

159
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue.

160
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,840
Good boy, Buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.

161
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,360
-Bless you, Woody.
-All right, now.

162
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,000
Back to Andy's room.

163
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,520
Way to go, cowboy.

164
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,200
-Golly bob howdy!
-Woody, I'm slipping!

165
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,200
Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this!

166
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,600
-Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!
-Hey, that's not her toy!

167
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,480
What's that little gal think she's doin'?

168
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,200
Mommy, Mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?

169
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,800
Oh, honey. You don't want
that toy. It's broken.

170
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,120
There's a snake in my boot.

171
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,840
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!

172
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,640
Little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...

173
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,800
A hat!
I found him! I found him! I found him!

174
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,440
Buster! Quiet down!

175
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,280
-Excuse me. Can I help you?
-Yes.

176
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,480
You can help take his paws off my pal.

177
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,040
I'll give you 50 cents for all this junk.

178
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,600
-Oh, now, how did this get down here?
-Hand her the sheriff.

179
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,200
Nice and easy.

180
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,960
-$5.
-I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.

181
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,480
Nowjust walk away.

182
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,880
-Wait.
-The other way.

183
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,640
-I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
-50 bucks ain't bad.

184
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,200
-It's not for sale.
-Everything's for sale.

185
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,800
-Or trade. You like my watch?
-Sorry.

186
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,360
-He's safe. Way to go Andy's mom!
-She showed him!

187
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,680
Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.

188
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,240
Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.

189
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,800
-Hold on.
-What's up?

190
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,520
What is it, Buzz?

191
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,480
What's happening?

192
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
What's he doing?

193
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,200
I can't watch!
Can someone cover my eyes?

194
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,880
-He's stealin' Woody!
-What? He can't take Woody.

195
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
It's illegal.

196
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,720
-Where's he going?
-Do something.

197
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,000
Buzz!

198
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,280
Get him, Buzz.

199
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,440
Where's the red jacket?

200
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,040
Why would someone steal Woody?

201
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,080
All right.
Let's review this one more time.

202
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,480
At precisely 8:32-ish,

203
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,440
Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped.

204
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,800
Exhibit B,
a composite sketch of the kidnapper.

205
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,960
-He didn't have a beard like that.
-Fine. Etch, give him a shave.

206
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,680
The kidnapper was bigger than that.

207
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,120
-Oh, picky, picky, picky.
-Let's just go straight to Exhibit F.

208
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
The kidnapper's vehicle.

209
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,200
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.

210
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,400
Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.

211
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Hey. Put a cork in it.

212
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,760
-How do you spell FBl?
-My crime scene!

213
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Oh, why don't you watch
where you're going, Godspilla?

214
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,480
-I didn't know there was a crime scene.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

215
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,040
A little quiet, please. Thank you.

216
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Lazy toy brain.

217
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,320
-Lousy try, Brian.
-What are you doing, Buzz?

218
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,240
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's I.D. tag.

219
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
-Liz try bran.
-It's just a licence plate.

220
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,200
-It's just a jumble of letters.
-Yeah, and there are about

221
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,200
3.5 million registered cars
in the tri-county area alone.

222
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,800
Lou's thigh burn.

223
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,520
Oh, this can't help.
Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.

224
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,480
Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on!

225
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,320
-Al's Toy Barn.
-Al's Toy Barn!

226
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,800
Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.

227
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,360
It's the chicken man!

228
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,560
That's our guy.

229
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,600
I knew there was something
I didn't like about that chicken.

230
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

231
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,880
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,

232
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,760
because I am in the middle
of something really important.

233
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,400
You, my little cowboy friend,

234
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,960
are gonna make me
big buck, buck, bucks.

235
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,120
Andy!

236
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,760
I can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.

237
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,800
All the way to work!

238
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,680
What? Whoa!

239
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,280
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy!

240
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,240
Stop it! Sit, I said!

241
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,640
Whoa! Whoa.

242
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,320
Yee-haw!

243
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!

244
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,000
-It's really you!
-What's me?

245
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,200
There's a snake in my boot.

246
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,080
-It is you!
-Please stop saying that.

247
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,600
Prospector said someday you'd come.

248
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,480
Sweet mother ofAbraham Lincoln!

249
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,880
The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya!

250
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,520
Say "hello" to the Prospector!

251
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,400
-It... It's a box.
-He's mint in the box.

252
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,280
Never been opened.

253
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,080
Turn me around, Bullseye,
so I can see.

254
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,840
Why, the prodigal son has returned.

255
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,600
Yee-haw!

256
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,840
It's you! It's you!

257
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,520
You're here! It's you! It's you! It's you!

258
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,920
Okay. I'm officially freaked-out now.

259
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,840
Oh, we've waited countless years
for this day.

260
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,320
-It's good to see you, Woody.
-Listen. I don't know...

261
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,040
-Hey, how do you know my name?
-Everyone knows your name, Wood-y.

262
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,800
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? Bullseye?

263
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,400
That's me.

264
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,360
Wow.

265
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,320
Holy cow.

266
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,400
Cowboy Crunchies,

267
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,920
the cereal that's sugar-frosted
and dipped in chocolate,

268
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,360
proudly presents...

269
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,160
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

270
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,160
There's Jessie
the yodelling cowgirl

271
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,880
Look it! That's me!

272
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,160
-Bullseye, he's Woody's horse
-He's a smart one

273
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,840
Pete the old Prospector

274
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,240
Has anyone seen my pick?

275
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,600
And the man himself
Of course, it's time for Sheriff Woody

276
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,800
He's the very best

277
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,000
He's the rootin'-est
tootin'-est cowboy

278
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,360
In the wild, wild west

279
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,000
Woody's Roundup

280
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,440
I can't find it! It doesn't seem
to be on any of these stations.

281
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
-Keep looking.
-You're going too slow.

282
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,040
Let me take the wheel.

283
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
It's too fast.

284
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,600
-How can you even tell what's on?
-I can tell.

285
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,120
Stop! Back, back, back!

286
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,040
Too late. I'm in the 40s.
Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster.

287
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,080
-Back, back! Stop!
-And look for the giant chicken!

288
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,440
Now, Etch!

289
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,480
That's where I need to go.

290
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,920
You can't go, Buzz.
You'll never make it there.

291
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,200
Woody once risked his life to save me.

292
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,440
I couldn't call myself his friend
if I weren't willing to do the same.

293
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,160
So who's with me?

294
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

295
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,160
This is for Woody when you find him.

296
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
All right,

297
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,440
but I don't think it'll mean
the same coming from me.

298
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,320
Mr. Buzz Lightyear,
you just gotta save my pal Woody.

299
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,280
I'll do my best, son.

300
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,240
Okay, fellas. Let's roll.

301
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,120
Geronimo!

302
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,360
You'd think with
all my video game experience,

303
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,680
I'd be feeling more prepared.

304
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,280
The idea is to let go.

305
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,440
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

306
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,640
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!

307
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,360
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!

308
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,480
They don't call this

309
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,520
the old abandoned mine
for nothin', Prospector.

310
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,280
I reckon we oughta get outta here.

311
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,000
Where's my gold?
Hold on. I'll light me a candle.

312
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,800
This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.

313
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,680
Blast us to smithereens!
That there's dynamite!

314
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,120
-Holy tarnation.
-I'll call for help.

315
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,800
Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody.
Now scurry!

316
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,240
Good job, Bullseye.

317
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,240
I reckon the new schoolhouse
is finally done.

318
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,520
What's that?

319
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,440
Jessie and Prospector are trapped
in the old abandoned mine,

320
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,720
and Prospectorjust lit a stick
of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle,

321
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,720
and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?

322
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,200
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

323
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,800
You're fannin' the flames, Jessie!
It takes brains to put out that fire.

324
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
My biscuits are burnin'!

325
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,280
Will Woody
and Bullseye land to safety?

326
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,640
Can they reach Jessie
and Stinky Pete in time?

327
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,840
Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion, "Woody's Finest Hour."

328
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,280
All right! All right! Next tape!

329
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,080
Hey, wait.
What happened? What happens next?

330
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,840
-Come on! Let's see the next episode!
-That's it.

331
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,680
-What?
-The show was cancelled after that.

332
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,200
Wait. What about the gold mine and
the cute little critters and the dynamite?

333
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,960
That was a great show!
I mean, why cancel it?

334
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,360
Two words, Sput-nik.

335
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,120
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.

336
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,560
I know how that feels.
But, still, my own show.

337
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,200
-I mean, look at all this stuff!
-Didn't you know?

338
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,480
Why, you're valuable property!

339
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,520
I wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

340
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,200
I'm on a yo-yo.

341
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,400
Oh, hey. Nice teeth.
And yet still a good-lookin' guy.

342
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,840
Oh, it's a bank! Cool.

343
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,000
What do you do?
You push the hat, and out...

344
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,280
Oh, out come bubbles. Clever.

345
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,720
Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do?

346
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
I get it.

347
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,320
"There's a snake in my boot."

348
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,840
Oh, hey, Bullseye. Go long! Go long!

349
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,200
A record player!

350
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,200
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

351
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,680
Okay, now. Slow.

352
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,880
Oh, that's funny, Bullseye.

353
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

354
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,040
Not bad.

355
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,800
It's time forWoody's Roundup

356
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,720
He's the very best

357
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,000
He's the rootin'-est
tootin'-est cowboy...

358
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,200
Look at us! We're a complete set!

359
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,200
-Now it's on to the museum.
-Museum?

360
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
-What museum?
-THE museum.

361
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,640
We're being sold
to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.

362
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,840
-That's in Japan!
-Japan?

363
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,600
No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan.

364
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,920
What do you mean?

365
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,480
I got to get back home to
my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See?

366
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,680
-He still has an owner.
-Oh, my goodness.

367
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,720
No. Can't go.

368
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
I can't do storage again. I just can't!

369
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,960
-Jessie. Jessie.
-I won't go back in the dark!

370
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,400
What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?

371
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,280
Well, we've been in storage
for a long time

372
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,720
waiting for you.

373
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
-Why me?
-The museum's

374
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,320
only interested in the collection
if you're in it, Woody.

375
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,960
Without you, we go back into storage.

376
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,960
-It's that simple.
-It's not fair!

377
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,560
How can you do this to us?

378
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,160
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.

379
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,240
-You see, I was in this yard sale...
-Yard sale?

380
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,600
Why were you in a yard sale
if you have an owner?

381
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,480
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
I was trying to save another toy when...

382
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,200
Was it because you're damaged?
Did this Andy break you?

383
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,760
Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no!
It was... It was an accident.

384
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,560
-I mean...
-Sounds like he really loves you.

385
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,840
It's not like that, okay?
And I'm not going to any museum!

386
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,560
Well, I'm not going back into storage!

387
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,840
Al's coming!

388
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,960
Go! Go on, Jessie.

389
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Jessie, look at me.

390
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,640
I promise you'll come out of the box.
Now go! Go!

391
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,880
It's show time!

392
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,920
Oh, money, baby.
Money, money, money.

393
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
And now

394
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,520
the main attraction.

395
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,240
No! His arm! Where's his arm?

396
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,800
No. No, no, no, no!

397
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,480
What am I gonna do? I know. I know.

398
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,040
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!

399
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,480
-Hello?
-It's me. It's Al.

400
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,680
I got an emergency.

401
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,440
-I'm busy.
-Yes, we're all busy.

402
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,200
Look. It has to be tonight.

403
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,480
All right. All right.
But first thing in the morning.

404
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,240
It's gone! I can't believe it!

405
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,160
-My arm is completely gone!
-All right. Come here. Let me see that.

406
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,080
Oh, it's just a popped seam,

407
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,240
easily repaired.

408
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,280
-You should consider yourself lucky.
-Lucky?

409
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Are you shrink-wrapped?
I am missing my arm!

410
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,880
Big deal.

411
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,880
Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy

412
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,480
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.

413
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,280
Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.

414
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,760
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.

415
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,280
All right.
Nobody look till l get my cork back in.

416
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,520
Good work, men. Two blocks down
and only 19 more to go.

417
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,760
-What?
-Nineteen?

418
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,280
Are we gonna do this all night?
My parts are killing me.

419
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,400
Come on, fellas.

420
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,680
Did Woody give up when Sid
had me strapped to a rocket?

421
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
-No.
-No.

422
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,200
And did he give up when you threw him
out of the back of that moving van?

423
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,400
-Oh, you had to bring that up.
-No, he didn't!

424
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,720
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

425
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,560
Now let's move out!

426
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,960
And that concludes
our broadcast day.

427
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,560
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.

428
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,000
Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.

429
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,520
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember? Just go.

430
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,560
Bullseye... All right. All right.

431
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,080
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.

432
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,160
Over here. Attaboy.

433
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,600
Okay, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.

434
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,680
Bullseye. Cut it out.

435
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,640
Stop it.
Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

436
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,880
Stop it.

437
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,600
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

438
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,000
No, Officer! I swear. What?

439
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,960
Get in there.
There you go. Cheap case.

440
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,640
Where is the remote?

441
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,880
Why don't I put it in the same place
every... Oh, here it is.

442
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,680
What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry
I can't help you guys out.

443
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,600
Really, I am. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.

444
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,480
What? You think I did that?

445
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,880
Oh, right, right.
The TVjust happened to turn on,

446
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,200
and the remote magically ended up
in front of you!

447
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,360
-You calling me a liar?
-Well, if the boot fits...

448
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,560
Say that again.

449
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,760
If the boot fits.

450
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,280
Okay, cowboy.

451
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,120
How do you like that?
Take it back! Take it back!

452
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

453
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,640
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

454
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,600
I don't know
how that television turned on,

455
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,720
but fighting about it
isn't helping anything.

456
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,040
-If I had both my arms...
-The fact is, you don't, Woody,

457
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,360
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.

458
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,960
-The cleaner will come, fix your arm...
-And then I'm outta here!

459
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,800
Oh, no, no.
Bullseye, don't take it that way.

460
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,360
-It's just that Andy...
-Andy, Andy, Andy.

461
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,880
That's all he ever talks about.

462
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,000
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?

463
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,760
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over $6 in change?

464
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,720
Losing health units. Must rest.

465
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,480
Is everyone present and accounted for?

466
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,800
Not quite everyone.

467
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,920
-Who's behind?
-Mine.

468
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,920
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?

469
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,840
-Not now, Hamm.
-Oh, I love riddles. Why?

470
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,480
To get to the chicken
on the other side!

471
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,360
The chicken!

472
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,200
-Oh, well. We tried.
-We'll have to cross.

473
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
What the...

474
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,040
You're not turning me
into a mashed potato.

475
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,240
I may not be a smart dog,
but I know what roadkill is.

476
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,840
There must be a safe way.

477
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,160
Okay.
Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.

478
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,600
Drop!

479
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,760
Go!

480
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,600
Drop! I said "drop"!

481
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,960
Go!

482
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,600
Drop.

483
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,680
Go.

484
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,360
That went well.

485
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,000
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.

486
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,640
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

487
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,240
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?

488
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,840
So, how long is this gonna take?

489
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,680
You can't rush art.

490
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Oh, no. It's closed.

491
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,080
We're not preschool toys, Slinky.
We can read.

492
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,720
Hey, Joe, you're late.

493
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,760
We've got a ton of toys to unload.

494
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,120
All right. All right.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

495
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,200
All right. Let's go.

496
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,440
But the sign says it's closed.

497
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,040
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!

498
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,760
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going
to find Woody in this place?

499
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,480
Look for Al. We find Al,
we find Woody. Now move out!

500
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,880
-Woody?
-Woody.

501
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,920
There you go.

502
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,400
He's for display only.

503
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,840
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.

504
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,120
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

505
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,560
Wow.

506
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,160
I could use one of those.

507
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,240
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.

508
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,160
It's extortion. That's what it is.

509
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,280
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only...

510
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,480
I thought we could search in style.

511
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,440
Nice going there, Hamm. So how about
letting a toy with fingers drive?

512
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,600
Am I really that fat?

513
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,840
-What are you doing?
-You're in direct violation

514
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,080
of Code 6404.5,

515
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,640
stating all Space Rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep

516
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,440
until awakened
by authorised personnel.

517
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Oh, no.

518
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,800
You're breakin' ranks, Ranger.

519
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,440
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

520
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,120
-I've got an AWOL Space Ranger.
-Tell me I wasn't this deluded.

521
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,280
No back talk!
I have a laser, and I will use it.

522
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,760
Mean the laser that's a light bulb?

523
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,760
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, Space Ranger.

524
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,200
Or should I say "traitor"?

525
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,000
-I don't have time for this.
-Halt!

526
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,840
I order you to halt!

527
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,520
Listen to me. Listen. Wait.

528
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,440
-We've been down this aisle already.
-We've never been down this aisle.

529
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
-It's pink.
-Face it. We're lost.

530
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Back it up. Back it up.

531
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,320
What a great party!

532
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,160
How low can you go?
How low can you go?

533
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,120
Excuse me, ladies.

534
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,160
Does anyone know where we might
find the Al ofAl's Toy Barn?

535
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,560
I can help.

536
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,320
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.

537
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,360
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,

538
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,120
and no flash photography.

539
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,440
-Thank you.
-I'm a married spud.

540
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,120
-I'm a married spud.
-Then make room for the single fellas.

541
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,240
To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle.
Developed in 1.967,

542
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,680
the original series had 16 cars,
including the Corvette.

543
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,880
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's Al's office?

544
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,880
Please hold all questions
until the end of the tour. Thank you.

545
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,320
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!

546
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,040
-Excuse me, sir.
-Get this outta here, geekosaur.

547
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,200
-Look out!
-Stop, stop, stop!

548
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,000
Turn into the spin, Barbie!

549
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,120
My source of power!

550
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,960
No! Come back! Hey!

551
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,400
Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down!

552
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,480
Dinosaur overboard! Slow down!

553
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,920
Remain seated, please.

554
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,480
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a Space Ranger.

555
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,120
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?

556
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,640
Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.

557
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,360
Let me go! You don't realise
what you're doing!

558
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,160
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.

559
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,160
In 1.995, shortsighted retailers did not
order enough dolls to meet demand.

560
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,200
-Hey, Buzz!
-Halt! Who goes there?

561
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,760
Quit clownin' around
and get in the car!

562
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,360
Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg!

563
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,360
-You do?
-Come on. I'll tell you on the way.

564
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,720
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong
Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz!

565
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,880
Say, where'd you get
the cool belt, Buzz?

566
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,400
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.

567
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,000
No!

568
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,240
It's like printing my own money.

569
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,720
Yeah? What?

570
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,800
Mr. Konishi.
Yes, I have the pictures right here.

571
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,360
In fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the office to fax them to you.

572
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,240
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin' up!

573
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,920
Oh, wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out of the box!

574
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,120
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!

575
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,160
Hi! Hello!

576
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Great. Now you can go.

577
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,320
Well, what a good idea.

578
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,360
Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.

579
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,600
She's been through
more than you know.

580
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,040
Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?

581
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,760
It's the least you can do.

582
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,640
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.

583
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,920
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

584
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,640
Thought I'd get one last look at the
sun before I get packed away again.

585
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,920
Look, Jessie.
I know you hate me for leaving,

586
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,240
but I have to go back.

587
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,240
I'm still Andy's toy.

588
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,560
Well, if you knew him,
you'd understand. Andy's a real...

589
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,280
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.

590
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,720
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.

591
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,960
And when Andy plays with you,
it's like even though you're not moving,

592
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,880
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.

593
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,360
How did you know that?

594
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,280
Because Emily was just the same.

595
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,720
She was my whole world.

596
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,040
When somebody loved me

597
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,400
Everything was beautiful

598
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,920
Every hour we spent together

599
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,880
Lives within my heart

600
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,840
And when she was sad

601
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,480
I was there to dry her tears

602
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,600
And when she was happy, so was l

603
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,800
When she loved me

604
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,920
Through the Summer and the Fall

605
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,080
We had each other
That was all

606
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,160
Just she and I together

607
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,920
Like it was meant to be

608
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,920
And when she was lonely

609
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,200
I was there to comfort her

610
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,520
And I knew that

611
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,680
She loved me

612
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,560
So the years went by

613
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,160
I stayed the same

614
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,840
But she began to drift away

615
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,800
I was left alone

616
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,120
Still I waited for the day

617
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,200
When she'd say

618
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,920
I will always love you

619
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,280
Lonely and forgotten

620
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,800
I never thought she'd look my way

621
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,120
She smiled at me and held me

622
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,040
Just like she used to do

623
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,800
Like she loved me

624
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,560
When she loved me

625
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,480
When somebody loved me

626
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,360
Everything was beautiful

627
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,960
Every hour we spent together

628
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,680
Lives within my heart

629
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:26,320
When she loved me

630
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,400
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.

631
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,280
But they forget you.

632
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,440
-Jessie, I didn't know.
-Just go.

633
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,720
How long will it last, Woody?
Do you really think

634
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,480
Andy is gonna take you to college
or on his honeymoon?

635
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,000
Andy's growing up,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

636
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,520
It's your choice, Woody.

637
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,560
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

638
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,840
You'll be adored
by children for generations.

639
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,440
Who am I to break up
the Roundup gang?

640
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,000
-Hey, Woody, are you in here?
-Nah. This one's empty too.

641
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,840
-Woody! Woody!
-Woody!

642
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,880
Pardon me, gentlemen,

643
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,280
but have either of you seen
a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

644
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,600
-Why, no, I haven't.
-Hey! He was talkin' to me!

645
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,280
-No! He was talkin' to me!
-Why, you...

646
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,560
You see, all along,

647
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,160
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,

648
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,040
but in fact the secret entrance is
to the left, hidden in the shadows.

649
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,600
To the left in the shadows. Got it.

650
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,320
-Someone's coming.
-Everyone, take cover.

651
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,760
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want
to bore you with the details.

652
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,160
Yes. Now, let me confirm
your fax number.

653
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,280
-01 1 ...
-01 1 . Wait.

654
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,200
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.

655
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,840
-It's him.
-The chicken man.

656
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,560
Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

657
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,800
That's the kidnapper, all right.

658
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,400
A kidnapper!
An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.

659
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,040
And the pičce de résistance!

660
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,280
I promise the collection will be
the crown jewel of your museum.

661
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,360
-It's Woody!
-Now that I have your attention,

662
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,560
imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?

663
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,920
-I'll pay anything you want.
-Yes! Yes!

664
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,040
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight to Japan!

665
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,640
Quick.
Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

666
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,440
He'll lead us to Zurg.
Move, move, move!

667
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,800
Don't touch my moustache!

668
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,440
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

669
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,720
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

670
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,200
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

671
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,200
-He didn't take the bag!
-No time to lose!

672
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,960
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.

673
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,080
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.

674
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,880
-Buzz?
-To infinity and beyond!

675
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,360
What are you? Insane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

676
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,320
I don't understand.

677
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,960
Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.

678
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,720
Blast. He's on level 23.

679
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,680
How are we gonna get up there?

680
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,480
Maybe if we find some balloons,
we could float to the top.

681
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,960
Are you kidding?
I say we stack ourselves up,

682
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,440
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

683
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,680
How about a ham sandwich
with fries and a hot dog?

684
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,680
What about me?

685
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,600
You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.

686
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,600
Troops! Over here.

687
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,880
Just like you said, lizard man.
"In the shadows to the left."

688
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,680
Okay. Let's move!

689
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,440
Mission log. Have infiltrated
enemy territory without detection

690
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,320
and are making our way
through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.

691
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,560
You know, I think that Buzz aisle
went to his head.

692
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,720
Oh, no. Which way do we go?

693
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
-This way!
-What makes you so sure?

694
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,440
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

695
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,160
We've been detected. The walls!
They're closing in! Quick!

696
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,280
Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.

697
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,920
Hey! Put me down, you moron!

698
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,400
Guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!

699
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,560
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone, grab hold!

700
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,760
What?

701
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,480
Buzz, why not just take the elevator?

702
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,600
They'll be expecting that.

703
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,120
Hey, Buzz! Stop!

704
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,640
Slow down!

705
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,440
To overnight six packages
to Japan is how much?

706
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,560
That's in yen, right?

707
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,800
Dollars?
You are deliberately taking advantage

708
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,840
of people in a hurry, you know that?

709
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,760
All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine.

710
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,840
I'll have the stuff in the lobby,
and you'd better be here in 15 minutes,

711
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,720
because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?

712
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,120
We're finally going.
Can you believe it?

713
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,240
That's custom-fitted

714
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,160
foam insulation
you'll be riding in, Bullseye.

715
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,320
First class all the way!

716
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,800
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.

717
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,600
I mean it. I really am!

718
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,280
-And why shouldn't you be?
-Yee-haw!

719
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,520
Swing your partner do-si-do

720
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,840
-Look at you, dancing cowboy!
-Look! I'm doin' the box step!

721
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,920
Hey, heads up down there!

722
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,720
-Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'.
-Hey, how much farther, Buzz?

723
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,400
Halfway there.

724
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,920
My arms can't hold on much longer!

725
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,160
Too heavy.

726
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,720
What was I thinking?

727
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,680
My antigravity servos!

728
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,360
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go of the wall.

729
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,760
-What?
-He wouldn't.

730
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,480
-One...
-He would.

731
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,840
Two...

732
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,040
Three!

733
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,800
To infinity and beyond!

734
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,600
Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.

735
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,600
Area secure.

736
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,480
It's okay, troops.

737
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,800
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!

738
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,600
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.

739
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,280
How 'bout givin' me
a little intro there, Jessie?

740
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,840
Introducing the high-ridin'-est
cowboy around...

741
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,800
You forgot "rootin'-tootin'-est"!

742
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,680
The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est
cowboy hero of all time,

743
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,720
Sheriff Woody!

744
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,840
Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?

745
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,520
Nary a bit,
not with Sheriff Woody around.

746
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,440
Wait, wait, wait! I got it!
This is great! Okay!

747
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,120
The bandits got the critters tied up
in the burning barn. Now the best part!

748
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,080
Help us! The barn's on fire!

749
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,320
I've got ya, critters. No need to worry.

750
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,680
Woody saves the day again!

751
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,840
Yee-haw!

752
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,800
Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye?

753
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,320
I have to ride off into the sunset...

754
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,600
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

755
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,360
Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, okay?

756
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,960
Oh, you are?

757
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,200
No, no, no. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it.

758
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,040
No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!

759
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,960
Mission log. Have reached
Zurg's command deck,

760
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,560
but no sign of him
or his wooden captive.

761
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,160
-Please, no!
-That's Woody!

762
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,480
This way!

763
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,200
Please, please, no!

764
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,680
Buzz, can you see? What's going on?

765
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,400
-Take that!
-To the left.

766
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,800
No, your left.

767
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,040
-Take it up higher.
-What's happening?

768
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,400
Oh, it's horrible.
They... They're torturing him.

769
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,800
-What are we gonna do, Buzz?
-Use your head!

770
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,720
But I don't wanna use my head!

771
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,400
What's going on here?

772
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,560
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you find me?

773
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,680
Watch yourself!

774
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,400
We're here to spring ya, Woody!

775
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
You heard of kung fu?

776
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,320
Well, get ready for pork chop.

777
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,440
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!

778
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,000
Hold it, now!
Hey, you don't understand!

779
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,040
These are my friends!

780
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,160
-Yeah, we're his friends!
-No, Rex, I mean they're my friends!

781
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,360
Hey, stop it!

782
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,200
Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey!

783
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,640
-Grab Woody, and let's go!
-Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down!

784
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,880
-Quick! To the vent!
-They're stealing him.

785
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,080
No!

786
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,440
Hold it right there!

787
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,120
-Buzz?
-You again?

788
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,000
-Thank goodness you're all right.
-Buzz, what is going on?

789
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,520
Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear,
and I'm in charge of this detachment.

790
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,960
No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.

791
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,600
-I'm Buzz Lightyear!
-I'm Buzz Lightyear!

792
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,480
So, who's the real Buzz?

793
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,960
-I am!
-Don't let this impostor fool you!

794
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,520
He's been trained by Zurg himself
to mimic my every move.

795
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,800
Buzz!

796
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,440
I had a feelin' it was you.

797
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,720
My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.

798
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,480
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?

799
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,520
It's all right, Space Ranger.
It's a code 546.

800
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,120
-You mean it's a...
-Yes.

801
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,200
-And he's a...
-Oh, yeah.

802
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,600
Your Majesty.

803
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,440
Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.

804
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,280
Al's selling you to a toy museum

805
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,120
-in Japan!
-I know.

806
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,160
It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go.

807
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,600
-What?
-Are you crazy?

808
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,640
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,

809
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,800
and these guys are my Roundup gang.

810
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,200
-What are you talking about?
-Woody's Roundup!

811
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,960
Oh, it's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.

812
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,480
Look! Look at me! See? That's me!

813
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,760
-This is weirdin' me out.
-Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

814
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,520
There was all this merchandise
that got packed up.

815
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,600
You should have seen it.

816
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,840
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

817
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,640
-"Was"?
-Stop this nonsense and let's go.

818
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,080
Nah, Buzz.

819
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,200
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

820
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,720
They need me to get into this museum.

821
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,440
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

822
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,000
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

823
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,440
You are a toy!

824
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,960
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.

825
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,720
And what do I do then, Buzz?
You tell me.

826
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,560
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

827
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,160
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.

828
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,080
And I travelled all this way
to rescue that toy

829
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,040
because I believed him.

830
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,440
Well, you wasted your time.

831
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,160
-Let's go, everyone.
-What about Woody?

832
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,320
He's not coming with us.

833
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,680
But... But Andy's coming home tonight.

834
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,200
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

835
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,440
I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.

836
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,880
To do what, Woody?

837
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,160
Watch kids from behind glass
and never be loved again?

838
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,960
Some life.

839
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,600
-Is everybody okay?
-Sheriff Woody!

840
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,160
-I knew you'd make it!
-Now, remember, deputies,

841
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,840
the real treasures are
your friends and family.

842
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,280
Before I go, kids, I want to share
somethin' special with you,

843
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,280
-for the times I'm not around.
-Good going, Woody!

844
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,800
I thought they'd never leave.

845
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,960
You've got a friend in me

846
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,520
Woody?

847
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,600
You've got troubles

848
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,480
Well, I've got 'em too

849
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,360
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you

850
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,320
We stick together
and see it through

851
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,680
'Cause you've got a friend in me

852
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:31,360
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

853
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,200
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe

854
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,720
But none of them will ever love you

855
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,280
The way I do
It's me and you, boy

856
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,840
And as the years go by

857
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,920
Our friendship will never die

858
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,400
You're gonna see it's our destiny

859
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,000
What am I doing?

860
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,640
-Buzz! Wait! Wait!
-Woody, where are you going?

861
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,800
You're right, Prospector.
I can't stop Andy from growing up.

862
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,040
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.

863
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,760
-No!
-Buzz!

864
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,800
-Yes?
-Yes?

865
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,720
I'm coming with you!

866
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,640
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll be back in just a second.

867
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,040
Way to go, cowboy!

868
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,840
-Hey, you guys... Come with me.
-What?

869
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,200
Andy will play with all of us. I know it!

870
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,120
Woody, I don't know. I...

871
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,720
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?

872
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,120
Come on, Jessie. This is what
it's all about, to make a child happy.

873
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,240
And you know it.
Bullseye, are you with me?

874
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,720
Okay, good boy.

875
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,880
Prospector, how 'bout you?

876
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,360
-Prospector?
-You're outta your box!

877
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,600
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,

878
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,160
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.

879
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,800
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, not Jessie.

880
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,480
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.

881
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,440
Let's not start off
by pointing fingers, shall we?

882
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,480
You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you?

883
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,120
Prospector, this isn't fair.

884
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,160
"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.

885
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:13,760
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store
shelf watching every other toy be sold.

886
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,680
Well, finally my waiting has paid off,

887
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,080
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!

888
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,960
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!

889
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,000
It's too late, Woody. That silly
Buzz Lightweight can't help you.

890
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,880
His name is Buzz Lightyear.

891
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,600
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.

892
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,560
It's stuck! What do we do?

893
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,080
Should I use my head?

894
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,480
It's Al!

895
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,520
Look at the time. I'm gonna be late!

896
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,960
Figures. I can't miss this flight!
I've gotta pack.

897
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,800
All right. Let's see.
Wallet, keys, tickets,

898
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,960
passport, beefjerky,
very expensive over there.

899
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,040
Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower.

900
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,560
I just gotta get outta here now!

901
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,680
Quick! To the elevator!

902
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,600
Hurry. I can hear it coming.

903
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,520
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear,

904
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,120
for the last time.

905
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,960
It's Zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!

906
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,920
Quick! Get on!

907
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,000
The emergency hatch! Come on!

908
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,840
-Come on! Hurry!
-But Buzz is in peril!

909
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,560
Buzz Buzz Buzz...

910
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,000
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.

911
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,920
I'll never give in. You killed my father!

912
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,720
No, Buzz. I AM your father.

913
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,360
No!

914
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,040
Come on! Come on! Come on!

915
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,680
Buzz, you could have
defeated Zurg all along!

916
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,720
You just need to believe in yourself!

917
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,840
-Prepare to die!
-I can't look!

918
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,840
Whoa!

919
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:01,040
I did it. I finally defeated Zurg!

920
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,040
Father.

921
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,560
Finally!

922
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,640
How are we gonna get him now?

923
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,240
Pizza, anyone?

924
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,360
-Go, go, go!
-I got it!

925
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,480
Buzz, are you coming?

926
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,920
No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.

927
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,400
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!

928
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,360
-Oh, you're a great dad.
-Farewell.

929
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,880
Does anyone know how to drive?

930
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,240
Slink, take the pedals.
Rex, you navigate.

931
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,960
Hamm and Potato,
operate the levers and knobs.

932
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,880
Whoa.

933
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,280
-Strangers.
-From the outside.

934
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,120
-Oh, no.
-He's at a red light! We can catch him!

935
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,000
Maximum power, Slink!

936
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,040
It turned green! Hurry!

937
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,720
-Why won't it go?
-Use the Wand of Power.

938
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,840
-Rex, which way?
-Left! No, no! I mean right!

939
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,720
That's right! No, I mean left!
Left is right!

940
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,560
Buzz, he's turning left! He's turning left!

941
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,520
Oh, boy!

942
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,680
Whoa!

943
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,240
Oh, I seriously doubt
he's gettin' this kind of mileage.

944
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,800
Go right! To the right!
Right, right, right, right!

945
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,600
Whoa!

946
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,520
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

947
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

948
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,760
The white zone is
for immediate loading and unloading...

949
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,600
No parking.

950
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,480
Guys, we can't park here!
It's a white zone!

951
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,840
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

952
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,320
-Final boarding call...
-There he is!

953
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,680
...for Far East AirIines
flight 451 to Tokyo.

954
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,800
All confirmed passengers
with boarding passes

955
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,840
must board at this time.

956
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,680
Passenger Twitch, passenger
Leon Twitch, please pick up...

957
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,320
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

958
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,080
-Will you leave me alone?
-Someone's coming!

959
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,640
-A puppy!
-Bark, bark, bark, bark.

960
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,000
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

961
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,040
Listen, flyboy.

962
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,920
The contents of that case are
worth more than you make in a year!

963
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,280
-You got that, sport? You be careful!
-I understand, sir.

964
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,000
Do you have a "fragile" sticker
or something?

965
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,800
I had a box of cookies once
that came back as crumbs!

966
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,080
The Mystic Portal!

967
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,880
Once we go through,
we just need to find that case.

968
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,080
-There's the case!
-No, there's the case!

969
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,680
You take that one! We'll take this one!

970
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,720
Whoa! Buzz!

971
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,520
Buzz, my back end's
goin' to Baton Rouge!

972
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,280
Slinky!

973
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,080
Here we come, Woody!
Woody, here we come! Woody!

974
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,440
Nice flash, though.

975
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,280
Okay, Woody, let's go!

976
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,120
Take that, space toy.

977
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,760
Hey! No one does that to my friend!

978
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,200
Your choice, Woody.

979
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,600
You can go to Japan together
or in pieces.

980
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,200
If he fixed ya once,
he can fix ya again. Now get in the box!

981
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,280
-Never!
-Fine!

982
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,280
-No!
-Gotcha!

983
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,800
Idiots! Children destroy toys!

984
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,000
You'll all be ruined, forgotten!

985
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,960
Spending eternity
rotting in some landfill!

986
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:44,000
Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you
learned the true meaning of playtime.

987
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,000
-Right over there, guys!
-No. No! No!

988
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,640
Atlantic Air flight 810
from Point Richmond

989
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,200
is now arriving at Gate 3.

990
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,320
Look, Barbie. A big, ugly man doll.

991
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,640
He needs a makeover.

992
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,880
Hi! You'll like Amy.

993
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,840
She's an artist!

994
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,440
Come on, hon!

995
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,760
Happy trails, Prospector.

996
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,520
-Buzz! Woody!
-Help us out here!

997
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,640
Hurry!

998
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,000
-Oh, no. Jessie! Come on!
-Oh, Woody!

999
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,040
Jessie!

1000
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,240
Come on, Buzz.

1001
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,720
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

1002
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,160
Hey-howdy-hey! Giddyap!

1003
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,360
Come on, Bullseye!

1004
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,640
Buzz, give me a boost!

1005
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,120
Woody!

1006
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,800
Here's the rest!

1007
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,040
Excuse me, ma'am, but I believe
you're on the wrong flight.

1008
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,880
-Woody!
-Come on, Jess.

1009
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,760
-It's time to take you home.
-But

1010
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,880
-what if Andy doesn't like me?
-Nonsense!

1011
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,920
Andy'll love you! Besides,

1012
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,160
-he's got a little sister.
-He does?

1013
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,640
-Why didn't you say so? Let's go!
-Whoa!

1014
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,520
Hold it! There's a couple
more bags coming from the terminal!

1015
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,360
Okay. On three.

1016
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,000
-One, two...
-Too late!

1017
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,880
Put 'em on the next flight!

1018
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,000
-This is bad.
-How are we gonna get outta here?

1019
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,720
Over there! Come on!

1020
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,960
-You sure about this?
-No! Let's go!

1021
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,080
Hold on, Woody!

1022
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,240
-What's a cowboy without his hat?
-Buzz!

1023
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,080
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tyres!

1024
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,480
Jessie, let go of the plane!

1025
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,840
What? Are you crazy?

1026
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,040
Just pretend it's
the final episode of Woody's Roundup.

1027
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,280
But it was cancelled!
We never saw if you made it!

1028
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,880
Well, then, let's find out together!

1029
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,520
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1030
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,920
Nice ropin', cowboy.

1031
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,560
That was definitely
Woody's finest hour!

1032
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,280
Your hat, partner.

1033
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,840
Let's go home.

1034
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,640
Yee-haw!

1035
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,120
Hey, Woody! Woody?

1036
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,720
Oh, wow! New toys!

1037
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,640
Cool! Thanks, Mom!

1038
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,360
It's Bazooka Jane
and herjet-propelled horse!

1039
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,880
Woody, Buzz, that polecat Zurg
has stolen my space cows!

1040
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,840
Andy, come on, hon. Time to go.

1041
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,520
-Hey, you fixed Woody!
-Yeah.

1042
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:24,960
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.

1043
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,880
Well, what do you know?

1044
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,080
Yee-haw!

1045
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,480
Oh, Bullseye,

1046
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,040
we're part of a family again!

1047
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,400
Ma'am, I...

1048
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,840
I wanted to say
you're a bright young woman

1049
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,720
with a beautiful "yarnful" of hair.

1050
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,880
"Hairful" of yarn. It's...

1051
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:52,960
I must go.

1052
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,640
Well, aren't you the sweetest
space toy I ever met?

1053
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,560
What's that? Bark, bark?

1054
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,320
This fella says he needs to go out
back for a little private time.

1055
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,320
That critter needs help!

1056
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,280
Hey, Rex,
I could use a hand over here, buddy.

1057
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,080
I don't need to play. I've lived it!

1058
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,240
No, no, no, no! Oh, nuts!

1059
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,720
Welcome to Al's Toy Barn.

1060
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,480
We've got the lowest prices in town.

1061
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,080
Everything for a buck, buck, buck.

1062
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,240
Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.

1063
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,480
Oh, Andy did a great job, huh?
Nice and strong!

1064
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,080
I like it. Makes you look tough.

1065
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,080
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

1066
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,960
You saved their lives? Oh, my hero!

1067
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,440
And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!

1068
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,600
Daddy!

1069
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,160
Oh, no.

1070
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,440
Wheezy, you're fixed!

1071
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,720
Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the toy
box and found me an extra squeaker.

1072
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,760
-And how do you feel?
-Oh, I feel swell.

1073
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,640
In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.

1074
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:22,240
You've got a friend in me

1075
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,840
You just remember
what your old pal said

1076
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,440
Babe, you've got a friend in me

1077
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,960
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1078
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,320
Come on over.
Oh, you are such a big girl.

1079
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,400
Andy, you think she's ready
to drive the car yet?

1080
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,240
Yeah, and I can teach her.

1081
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,960
-You still worried?
-About Andy?

1082
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:46,240
-Nah. It'll be fun while it lasts.
-I'm proud of you, cowboy.

1083
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,760
Besides, when it all ends, I'll have old
Buzz Lightyear to keep me company

1084
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,360
for infinity and beyond.

1085
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:58,040
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1086
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,320
-You've got a friend in me
-Yes, you do

1087
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,960
-You've got a friend in me
-That's the truth

1088
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,200
You've got a friend

1089
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,240
In me

1090
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:16,960
Yeah!

1091
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,920
-Speed.
-Marker.

1092
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,360
And action.

1093
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,840
Okay. A little help here, please.

1094
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,080
-What are we gonna do, Buzz?
-Use your head!

1095
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,520
But I don't wanna use my head!

1096
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,120
-Speed.
-Marker.

1097
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,760
Okay, and pull back.

1098
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,320
-I don't remember eating that.
-Cut.

1099
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,200
-I can't believe this.
-That's the fifth time.

1100
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,080
-What row is that guy in?
-Sorry.

1101
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,600
I had that bean burrito for lunch.
Okay, l'm all right now. Sorry.

1102
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,560
And action.

1103
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:09,400
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

1104
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,640
And if you get hungry,
here's some cheese puffs. And a key.

1105
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,840
I don't know what it's for,
but you never know.

1106
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,760
-Speed.
-Marker.

1107
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,160
And action.

1108
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,520
Could...? Should we just...?

1109
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,080
Should that just be part
of the movie now?

1110
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,840
He lost... He lost his string.

1111
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,400
And the golf ball,
if you have time for golf.

1112
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:42,160
And a plastic steak
and a rubber ducky and a yo-yo.

1113
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,280
-Who's behind?
-Mine.

1114
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,760
All right, cut. Good take.

1115
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,320
What good acting.
That was a good take.

1116
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,920
You're such a cute little bottom.

1117
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Look at you. Look at you.
Look at you. Look at you.

1118
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,520
In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.

1119
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:06,120
Mr. Mike, I'm so sorry.
Did I hurt your equipment?

1120
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,200
You gotta aim it right here at my flipper.

1121
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,800
I'm not a very good catch.

1122
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,360
-Okay, I'm ready for another take.
-Let's go again.

1123
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,320
Oh, no! Oh, no,
I think I swallowed my squeaker!

1124
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,760
And an extra-bouncy bouncy ball.

1125
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,120
And some extra teeth.
Be careful, they chatter.

1126
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,480
Whoa!

1127
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,440
-Marker.
-And action.

1128
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,160
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

1129
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,240
What? What're you laughing about?

1130
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,480
Real funny, Woody.

1131
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,920
We're losing our light.
Wipe it off and let's go again.

1132
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,360
Golly bob howdy.

1133
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,480
What? What's so funny? Woody!

1134
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,320
-Darn it, Woody!
-Okay, let's go again.

1135
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,800
And crayons, in case you get bored.

1136
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,760
And some blue Play-Doh.

1137
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,600
Isn't this exciting, Heimlich?
Our first day of shooting.

1138
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so exciting!

1139
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,120
You know, I can't believe you talked
them into making A Bug's Life 2.

1140
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,840
Yeah, I can hardly believe it also.

1141
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,680
But there's a little baby tiny thing
I forgot to tell you.

1142
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,720
What's that, Heimlich?

1143
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,680
Well, it's a "2" movie,
but it's not A Bug's Life 2.

1144
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,200
What...? I don't understand.
What is it then?

1145
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,640
And action.

1146
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,120
-Marker.
-And action.

1147
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,360
Bullseye, are you with me?

1148
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,000
Okay, good boy.

1149
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,200
Prospector, how 'bout you?

1150
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,360
And so, you two are
absolutely identical?

1151
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,960
You know, I'm sure I could get you
a part in Toy Story 3.

1152
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,840
I'm sorry. Are we back?

1153
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,440
All right, girls.
Lovely talking with you.

1154
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,600
Anytime you'd like some tips on acting,
I'd be glad to chat with you.

1155
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,840
All right, off you go then.

1156
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,360
-Speed.
-Let me check focus.

1157
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,200
Did you make it
into the first Toy Story?

1158
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,520
In the letterbox copy, you can see
my arm grabbing Woody's ankle.

1159
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,560
What will you do next?

1160
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,840
I'm up for this villain
in a toothpaste commercial.

1161
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,200
Wow, that's great.

1162
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,040
And a dime, call me.
And monkey chow.

1163
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,640
Monkey chow? For what?

1164
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,080
Well, for the monkeys, of course.

1165
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,520
Come on, monkeys.

1166
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,760
That's it. I draw the line at monkeys.
Get my agent on the phone!

1167
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,920
-Marker.
-And action.

1168
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,480
It's your choice, Woody.

1169
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,760
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

1170
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,200
Good heavens. Was that me?

1171
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,880
Oh, my. I am so sorry.

1172
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,040
I guess that's why they call me
Stinky Pete.

1173
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,480
Okay, let's cut.

1174
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,600
We are so glad you came.

1175
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,360
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1176
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,600
Bye-bye, now. Bye. Bye-bye.

1177
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,400
Remember, please discard all candy
wrappers and popcorn containers

1178
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,520
in the nearest trash receptacle.
Thank you.

1179
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,920
Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye. Bye.

1180
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,840
Okay.

1181
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,400
Are they all gone?

1182
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,360
Is everybody gone?

1183
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,920
Huh?

1184
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,600
Good. Oh, my gosh,
my cheeks are killing me.

1185
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:24,520
I can't keep smiling like this any more.
I am exhausted.

1186
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,600
I think I need a break.

1187
01:27:26,680 --> 01:34:13,560
A little break? Okay.
